## Deerfield Green

We help ARR and hybrid businesses (SaaS, platforms, OEMs) pivot from unit or perpetual models to scalable recurring revenue, then layer in AI agents to grow revenue and expand margins. We work with founders and revenue leaders who need to translate complex pricing, packaging, and licensing decisions into clear growth, healthier free cash flow, and investor‑ready metrics.

We work across **pricing and packaging**, **renewals and upsell motions**, **channel and sales compensation**, and **AI agent design** to create a coherent, data‑driven revenue system. Our team has led recurring‑revenue transformations for Fortune‑class and high‑growth clients, drawing on 40+ subscription and consumption engagements, benchmark studies spanning ~150 subscription companies, and hands‑on experience operating P&Ls and GTM teams.

Typical work starts with a **rapid assessment**—stakeholder interviews, benchmark heatmaps, CAC/ACV and NRR diagnostics—to surface the biggest “big rocks” and quantify impact. We then run an intensive **3‑day design workshop** and co‑create a **30‑60‑90 day execution roadmap** that your teams own. From there, we either stand up an initial pricing, compensation, or AI‑agent pilot, or embed as a **fractional revenue and AI team** to drive measurable improvements in ARR growth, NRR, churn, CAC payback, and free‑cash‑flow profile.
